The ged lightweight text edito

Benjamin Good and James Hartzell

INTRODUCTION
============
We developed ged to be a simple light-weight text editor using the gtk+
library. It is designed as a lighter replacement for gedit.

INSTALLATION
============

There are two versions of ged in this release; the C version, and the Python
version. The C version handles multiple windows better, and in line with
Gnome applications such as AbiWord (i.e. File=>New creates a new window). 

To install the python version, mark ged.py executable, and copy it to an
appropriate location with an appropriate name (e.g. /usr/local/bin/ged).

To install the C version, run make, and copy the resulting executable "ged"
to an appropriate location (e.g. /usr/local/bin).

USAGE
=====

This program only creates one window per document, but the windows have one
shared instance. They can be treated as though they were entirely independent,
however. Files can be opened using the "open" menu item, or by specifying them
as arguments on the command line.

COPYING
